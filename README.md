# Phishing-Campaign

## Objective

The Phishing Campaign project is a Certificate path hosted by Mastercard, aimed to design a phishing email simulation aimed for a Security Awareness team. The primary focus was to create a believable phishing email that an unaware employee might be tricked by, then create a learning presentation for teams that need security awareness training. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of types of phishing emails and how to train employees to avoid them.

### Skills Learned

- Creating realistic phishing emails to mimic realistic attacks.
- Crafting Phishing presentations to educate non-security personel.
- Ability to recognize types of phishing & social engineering tactics.
- Recognizing vulnerabilities that could be taken advantage of from phishing attempts. 

### Tools Used

- Microsoft Word
- Microsoft Powerpoint
