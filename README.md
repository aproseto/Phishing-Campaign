# Phishing-Campaign

## Objective

The Phishing Campaign project is a Certificate path hosted by Mastercard, aimed to design a phishing email simulation aimed for a Security Awareness team. The primary focus was to create a believable phishing email that an unaware employee might be tricked by, then create a learning presentation for teams that need security awareness training. This hands-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of types of phishing emails and how to train employees to avoid them.
